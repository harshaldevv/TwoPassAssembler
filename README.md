# TwoPassAssembler
Assignment Details
The project requires you to design an Assembler which takes a text file as an input, which contains the Assembly code. The assembler must be able to translate the assembly code into machine code. The machine code generated must also be saved in a separate text file. There are no Macros and Procedures to be assembled. Decide your own error reporting strategy. Assume all operands are declared at the end of instructions, sequentially and in order of their appearance in the code. Each operand occupies one word.


The Two pass assembler was an assignment given in CSE112 ( Computer Organisation) at IIIT D ( second semester of my B.Tech[2019-2023])
A documentation (pdf) has also been added so that the assignment is understandble incase any doubt arises or to refer to incase you are doing the same project ( or assignment :P )
